  This plugin needs permission to write to the security audit log index when configured
  to use an OpenSearch Index for the audit log. By default the index will match the pattern
  'security-auditlog-'YYYY.MM.dd, but can be configured with the plugins.security.audit.config.index
  setting
cluster.actions:
  - cluster:monitor/health
index.actions:
  security-auditlog*:
    - indices:data/write/index*
